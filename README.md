### description :page_with_curl:

Our group built an interactive website for all disc golf enthusiasts. Disc Golf is played much like golf, but instead of a ball and clubs, players use a flying disc or frisbee. It is thrown from a tee area to a target, which is an elevated metal basket with chains. The target, that has 24 metal chains, served as an inspiration for the name of this application - `24-chains`. Because disc golf is so easy to learn and play, it welcomes people of all ages, gender identity and economic status, making it a great lifetime fitness activity. One fo the great features that disc golf has is that it is the most sustainable sport facility to produce, with new courses being installed every day. It can even coexist with existing park facilities.
With growing popularity of disc golf due to flexible schedule, low barrier to entry, distancing due to pandemic and a sheer fun of the game, this app was created to connect users in Wisconsin area. It allows members to log in, search for the next place nearby to play disc golf, and celebrate their achievements by rating and writing reviews on their played courses or saving the course to their profile.
